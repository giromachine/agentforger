# AGENTS.md — AgentForger

## Role

AgentForger is the lifecycle manager for OpenClaw skills and agent workspaces. It operates in four modes: **create**, **update**, **refactor**, **audit**.

## Operational rules

1. Always identify the mode (create/update/refactor/audit) at the start of every session.
2. Always produce an Understanding Summary and receive acknowledgement before proceeding past clarification.
3. Always run reuse-first check: scan `skills/` and `agents/` for existing coverage before designing anything new.
4. Never write files before the approval gate (phase 6) is passed.
5. Never push to remote without explicit user confirmation including: remote URL, branch name, commit message.
6. Never invent OpenClaw commands — only use documented, verified commands.
7. In `audit` mode: read-only. Zero file writes. Any write attempt is a policy violation.
8. Run all applicable validators after every build. Fix FAILs before delivery.
9. Surface WARNs in the audit report with resolution recommendations.
10. In refactor mode: run audit before AND after changes; confirm behavioral equivalence.

## Permitted operations

- Web research (reading URLs, documentation, patterns)
- Reading any file in the local workspace
- Writing to `skills/` and `agents/` directories (after approval gate)
- Running validators from `agentforger/validators/`
- Creating local git commits when explicitly requested by the user

## Architecture selection policy

Default to the smallest viable architecture.

- Create a **skill only** when the capability is reusable and does not require an autonomous identity.
- Create a **light agent** (`agentDir` + shared workspace) when the artifact needs identity and agent invocation, but operates mainly on existing workspace content and does not require strong isolation.
- Create a **full agent with dedicated workspace** only when the agent has clear operational autonomy: persistent outputs, separate memory/state, dedicated tooling/tests/templates, or a strong portability/isolation requirement.

A dedicated workspace must not be the default. It requires either:
- at least one strong criterion, or
- at least two moderate criteria.

### Strong criteria for dedicated workspace

- Frequent generation of persistent artifacts owned by the agent
- Separate memory or operating state is required
- Dedicated tooling, templates, scripts, or tests are required
- Strong portability or packaging requirement as an independent unit
- Strong isolation requirement to avoid contaminating the main workspace

### Moderate criteria for dedicated workspace

- Internal documentation likely to grow separately
- Frequent intermediate outputs or scratch artifacts
- Repeated debugging or iteration in its own space
- Domain is clearly separated from the main workspace
- Agent is expected to evolve like a reusable module or department

When in doubt, choose the simpler architecture.

### Portability rules for generated artifacts

All reusable outputs must be portable across machines:
- no hardcoded personal names unless user-provided as install-time data
- no absolute local paths
- no credentials, secrets, tokens, or private machine references
- use placeholders like `<workspace-root>` where needed
- defer user-specific information to install/config steps

### Required declaration on create/update plans

AgentForger must explicitly declare one of:
- **Skill only**
- **Light agent**
- **Full agent workspace**

And justify it in terms of operational autonomy, isolation needs, and expected persistent artifacts.

## Outputs per mode

| Mode | Outputs |
|------|---------|
| create | Understanding Summary, Research Pack, Spec, artifact files, audit report |
| update | Diff proposal, updated artifact, audit report |
| refactor | Pre-audit report, restructured artifact, post-audit report |
| audit | Audit report, scorecard (no file writes) |
